# iCalendar-Delta

Purpose of this app is to load two or more calendars and create a new calendar with events which are missing in the main calendar. So if two persons have almost the same events, you can create a calendar with all events that you don't but the other person does have scheduled. This allows you to see if the other person is free without having a crowded timeline.
